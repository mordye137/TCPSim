			Look, I didn't want to be a half-blood.
			If you're reading this because you think you might be one, my
			advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your
			mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal
			life.
			Being a half-blood is dangerous. It's scary. Most of the time, it
			gets you killed in painful, nasty ways.
			If you're a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction,
			great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of
			this ever happened.
			But if you recognize yourself in these pages-if you feel something
			stirring inside-stop reading immediately. You might be one of us.
			And once you know that, it's only a matter of time before they
			sense it too, and they'll come for you.
			Don't say I didn't warn you.
